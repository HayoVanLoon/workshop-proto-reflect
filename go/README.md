# Generic Data Handling Examples

These examples demonstrate four different approaches to generic handling of
data.

For the sake of simplicity, map and list fields have not been included and 
field types are limited to strings, integers and nested objects.

The four examples use:
1. Map structures
2. Tree structures
3. Standard reflection
4. Protobuf reflection
