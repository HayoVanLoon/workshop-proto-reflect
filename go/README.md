# Generic Data Manipulation Examples

These examples demonstrate four different approaches to generic manipulation of
data. For the sake of simplicity, map and list fields have not been included.  

The four examples use:
1. Map structures
2. Tree structures
3. Standard reflection
4. Protobuf reflection
