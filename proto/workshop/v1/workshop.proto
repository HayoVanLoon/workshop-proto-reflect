// An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica).
// Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species
// in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild
// ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found. Apples have been grown for
// thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North America by
// European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in
// many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.
